# Allan Gaia Pio 🔭

Hi, I'm Allan and I've started to study Web Development this year (2020). I've always wanted to start studying programming languages and finally I was able to start this new project and I'm eager to put my new skills into practice. I'm a former economist and my goal always was to develop content that is useful to other and as an economist I did it trhough data analasys of the brazillian educational system.

My goal is to have some solid skills with React and React Native for the Front-End. As for the Back-End, I'm studying Node and PostgreSQL.
I'm currently taking the GoStack Bootcamp from Rocketseat 🚀

### 🛠️ Projects I'm currently working on
I'm dedicating myself to develop a plataform togheter with the [Pontes da Terra NGO](https://pontesdaterra.com.br/) to register local farmers, making it easier for them to be reached by people interested in their products. This project is based on the #NLW1 from Rocketseat.
